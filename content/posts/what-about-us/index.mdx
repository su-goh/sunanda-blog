Every time I came back to Kuching, the first and most excited person I wanted to meet is this very special person. I came back this time just in time for your birthday. It was the first time I were here for your birthday since 2019, which was the year our friendship really deteriorated. 

This time though, is the first time I have seen you on make up, which was the birthday gift they gave you this year. While I do think you look great without, you on make up is not better or worse.

I picked a seat close to the center, and coincidentally, as *the birthday star* âœ¨, the middle seat was reserved for you. I tried my best not to ðŸ¤¤ looking straight at you, and hopefully I did not ðŸ˜‚. But I don't know why you looked prettier everytime I see you again. 

I don't know what else to write here haha. To be honest, while I do think you looked extra pretty, I don't feel like I did fall for you as much as I did years ago. 
>Is it because of numbness or have I really moved on?
