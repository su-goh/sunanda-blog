The night before she went for scuba diving, we went to a fancy restaurant owned by a mutual friend, to which he was late but he gave a number for her to call to the chef to get exclusive invite to the place. 

He seemed somewhat interested in her, at least from my jealous-ed and biased point of view of an obsessed crush, who would not allow another men to get water for us. I was paranoid that, he would contact her, given that he now has her number, and well I do not know if that happend, I found out that he followed her on Instagram a few days ago. My heart felt crashed, and it really wasn't fair, to me, I think.


It had been seven years, at least from what I vaguely remember, to which I refused to calculate the exact timeframe that I had fallen in love with her.

I was aware of our differnces since the very beginning. She was this smart person, to which I know that I would never be able to be on par with her. She has an amazing English communication skills. She is born in a somewhat well-off family. She enjoy Marvel films, to which I somewhat despise most of the time.


I have been trying, these few years, to narrow our differences, thinking that it would allow us to get along better, and perhaps, she would see me as a potential partner more. 

I worked very hard to show that I am smart, from falling deep in love with Physics so that I can show her cool knowledge, to which she enjoyed in the movie Interstellar too. I remembered my high school science project, in which I made a reversing fountain inspired by Now You See Me 2, because she really thought that was cool when we watched the film together. 

I never missed one single Marvel's film (ok actually 1) after I learned that she really enjoyed Avengers: Endgame and was obsessed with watching the interviews at that time, because I wanted to know what she was thinking and doing while I am away from her. 

While this is not really done for her, I pride my improvement in speaking English (and can even speak English exclsuively with her omg i could never do that in high school) so that she wouldn't think that there's a cultural and language barrier between us. 

I did my best to think about ways I can be wealthier, so that I can at least be somewhat on par with my rivals, though i know that I can never reach that level of rich-ness, not by my own hard work alone. Well, at least definitely not before she got married to someone else.

Knowing that she loves food is the prime motivation for me to learn to cook different kind of fancy dishes and pasteries, including watching Youtubers like Ahran Cho and Inga Lam.


I learned that she was sick yesterday. But I literally felt powerless. I was afraid that even a small gesture would register her uncomfortable given our history. 


It felt like I can do everything in the world but nothing would have changed. Maybe the world really aint a wish granting factory after all.
